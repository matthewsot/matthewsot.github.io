            The completely-visual proof of the log-sum rule. (Exercise from
            Donald Knuth's <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>)
        </li>
        <li>
            A \cup C = B \cup C and A \cap C = B \cap C implies A = B. (From my
            discrete mathematics course)
        </li>
        <li>
            A special case of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which can be
            modeled by and proved from a patterned, sub-divided rectangle.
            (Used in a problem from Knuth's TAoCP)
        </li>
        <li>
            The algebraic rule (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 visually with a
            physical square diagram. (From my evolution and ecology Biology
            course)

        <li>
            p^2 + pq = p for alleles in a Harvey-Weinberg equilibrium
            population. (Evolution-ecology course)
