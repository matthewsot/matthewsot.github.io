        I recently completed a summer research project developing a novel
        compiler system as an intern with Intel's AIPG, Office of the CTO.

                Modern computer architectures are becoming more heterogeneous
                and parallel, however existing compilers still assume outdated,
                von Neumann-like hardware. Existing solutions to this problem
                in the deep learning space (such as TVM and PlaidML) continue
                to place unreasonable assumptions on the target architecture
                (ex. a GPU with managed cache) or require significant manual
                input from the programmer (to determine data movement, lowering
                rules, and scheduling). We develop the first fully-automated
                compiler for heterogeneous parallel systems that can compile
                linear-algebra programs onto any system described as a graph of
                compute and memory nodes. In particular, hardware exposes
                instruction support in the same language that programs are
                described in, allowing the system to support arbitrary tensor
                instruction sets including matrix multiplication and
                convolution. Tests on an upcoming deep learning architecture
                show ISAM can achieve up to 3X faster execution times than
                state-of-the-art, hand-optimized kernel libraries. My work has
                already influenced compiler and software teams across the
                company.

            <p>
                We develop a compression method that solves the fundamental symmetry issue with rank-1 factorizations,
                implement it as a library module for the TensorFlow framework, and show that we achieve up to 60%
                better accuracy than all other methods (pruning, HashedNet, same-size network, simple factorization)
                while increasing inference speed by up to 14X with a custom, fused matrix multiplication kernel.
